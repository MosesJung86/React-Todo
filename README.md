# React-Todo
# This is a simple todo app created using React.js
# it has an add, delete and checkmark feature
# Using React, I implemented an input field with a character count that decreases as soon as you type something into the input field
# The button is also disabled if nothing is typed or if the character count is over 50
# I also implemented an overflow alert that pops up when you've typed over 50 characters and not only does it show you the text, it highlights the overflown text in red

# Anybody can contribute by trying to implement a completed boolean value for every task, edit function, and a clear completed function.

# Since this is a single page html file that has react on it, you can fork or clone this repo
# You can work directly on the file and to open, just open the todo.html file
